Course Materials: Quantitative Methods for Public Administration I

The purpose of this course is to provide doctoral students with basic skills and practice efficiently and effectively performing statistical modeling and analyzing statistical data to address critical issues in public administration. The course begins with a conceptual introduction to statistics and univariate properties of variable distributions (central tendency and dispersion, & location), and progresses through probability theory, bivariate association, analysis of variance, and simple and multivariate regression models.
While our focus remains in the domain of Public Administration, the course is built on ubiquitous foundations of statistics to facilitate application to other social science disciplines as well. You are encouraged to bring questions, discussion points, and extensions from other areas to broaden your exposure to the methods and conventions in your research areas.
